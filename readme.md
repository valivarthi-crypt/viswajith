## # Core Values of Devops

    		1. Culture
    		2. Automation
    		3. Measure
    		4.  Sharing

## # Three Principles Of Devops

- System Thinking (Concept to Cash)
- Amplifying Feedback Loops (ipofi) (Short Effective Feedback Loops)
- Continuous Experimentation and Continuous Learning (CE&L)

---

## # Devops Methodology

- People -> Process -> Tools
- Continuous Delivery (Develop->Test->Deploy -> Release(on small batches))
- Lean (Small Batches -> Work in progress limits -> Feedback Loops -> Visualization)
- Change Control (Visual Ops,CI)
- Infrastructure As A Code (Make System as Programmable)

---

## # Devops Pratices

- Incidents Command System
- Devolopers on Call
- Staus Pages (Communication)
- Blameless Postmortems
- Embedded Teams ( Add Op+Dev together )
- Cloud (IaaC)
- Andon Codes
- Dependency Injection
- Blue Green Deployments
- Chaos Monkey

---

## # Tools

- Only Ui No
- Trust + Verify
- Metrics for Feedback
- Check if well Behaved

---

## # Wall of confusion

- Develop - Operations

---

## # Communication (Blameless postmortem,Transperant Uptime)

- Prevent the similar outage,RC Analysis,Detection of Failures in Future(BP)
- a.Admit Failure b.Sound like Human c.Communication Channel d.Be Authentic

---

## # Collab

- Social Skills
- Some-one else job is easy
- Diff Skillsets together
- Optimal Team Size
- Chat Ops (Slack,Add in Push Notification) (Kuba)
