# Core Values of Devops

1> Culture
2> Automation
3> Measure
4> Sharing

# Three Principles Of Devops

1> System Thinking (Concept to Cash)
2> Amplifying Feedback Loops (ipofi) (Short Effective Feedback Loops)
3> Continuous Experimentation and Continuous Learning (CE&L)

# Devops Methodology

1> People -> Process -> Tools
2> Continuous Delivery (Develop->Test->Deploy -> Release(on small batches))
3> Lean (Small Batches -> Work in progress limits -> Feedback Loops -> Visualization)
4> Change Control (Visual Ops,CI)
5> Infrastructure As A Code (Make System as Programmable)

# Devops Pratices

1> Incidents Command System
2> Devolopers on Call
3> Staus Pages (Communication)
4> Blameless Postmortems
5> Embedded Teams ( Add Op+Dev together )
6> Cloud (IaaC)
7> Andon Codes
8> Dependency Injection
9> Blue Green Deployments
10> Chaos Monkey

# Tools

1> Only Ui No
2> Trust + Verify
3> Metrics for Feedback
4> Check if well Behaved

# Wall of confusion

1> Develop - Operations

# Communication (Blameless postmortem,Transperant Uptime)

1> Prevent the similar outage,RC Analysis,Detection of Failures in Future(BP)
2> a.Admit Failure b.Sound like Human c.Communication Channel d.Be Authentic

# Collab

1> Social Skills
2> Some-one else job is easy
3> Diff Skillsets together
4> Optimal Team Size
5> Chat Ops (Slack,Add in Push Notification) (Kuba)
